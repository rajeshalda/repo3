## Fixing AI Agent Dashboard Meeting Visibility (2/21/2025, 12:33:32 PM)

_**User**_

ai agent posted meetings are not saving in this file @ai-agent-meetings.json as recently i have rename the file can scan the codebase only for ai agent src

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you investigate why the meetings are not being saved in the renamed `ai-agent-meetings.json` file. Let me search through the codebase focusing on the AI agent source code to find relevant code handling meeting storage.

I can see the issue. After reviewing the code, I found that there's a discrepancy in the file names being used. The meetings are being saved to `posted-meetings.json`, but you've renamed the file to `ai-agent-meetings.json`. Let me help you fix this.

The file paths are defined in two places:

1. In `AIAgentPostedMeetingsStorage` class (`src/ai-agent/services/storage/posted-meetings.ts`), it uses:
```
'src/ai-agent/data/storage/json/posted-meetings.json'
```

2. In `StorageManager` class (`src/ai-agent/data/storage/manager.ts`), it also uses:
```
'posted-meetings.json'
```

Let me update these file paths to use the new filename. I'll edit both files:

---

_****_

```diff
  
      constructor() {
-         this.storagePath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'src', 'ai-agent', 'data', 'storage', 'json', 'posted-meetings.json');
+         this.storagePath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'src', 'ai-agent', 'data', 'storage', 'json', 'ai-agent-meetings.json');
      }
  
```

---

_****_

```diff
      private constructor() {
          this.storagePath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'src', 'ai-agent', 'data', 'storage', 'json');
-         this.meetingsFile = path.join(this.storagePath, 'posted-meetings.json');
+         this.meetingsFile = path.join(this.storagePath, 'ai-agent-meetings.json');
          this.initializeStorage();
      }
```

---

_****_

```diff
          this.baseUrl = 'https://api.myintervals.com';
          this.headers = {}; // Will be set when API key is loaded
-         this.postedMeetingsPath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'src', 'ai-agent', 'data', 'storage', 'json', 'posted-meetings.json');
+         this.postedMeetingsPath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'src', 'ai-agent', 'data', 'storage', 'json', 'ai-agent-meetings.json');
      }
  
```

---

I've updated all the references to the meetings file in the codebase to use the new filename `ai-agent-meetings.json`. The changes were made in three files:

1. `src/ai-agent/services/storage/posted-meetings.ts`
2. `src/ai-agent/data/storage/manager.ts`
3. `src/ai-agent/services/time-entry/intervals.ts`

Now the meetings should be properly saved to the `ai-agent-meetings.json` file. You may need to restart your application for these changes to take effect. Also, if you had any existing meetings in the old `posted-meetings.json` file, you might want to copy them over to the new file to preserve that data.

Is there anything else you'd like me to help you with?

_**User**_

i want to use only this @ai-agent-meetings.json file to saved posted meetings. delete this @posted-meetings.json file

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you delete the `posted-meetings.json` file since we've already updated all the code to use `ai-agent-meetings.json`. First, let me verify that all the data from `posted-meetings.json` is properly migrated to `ai-agent-meetings.json`.

---

_****_

Read file: src/ai-agent/data/storage/json/ai-agent-meetings.json

I notice that the data from `posted-meetings.json` hasn't been transferred to `ai-agent-meetings.json` yet. Let me help you migrate the data first, then delete the old file.

Now that I've copied all the data to `ai-agent-meetings.json`, let me delete the old `posted-meetings.json` file:

---

_****_



---

_****_



Great! I've completed the following tasks:

1. Copied all the existing meeting data from `posted-meetings.json` to `ai-agent-meetings.json`
2. Deleted the old `posted-meetings.json` file

The system is now configured to use only `ai-agent-meetings.json` for storing posted meetings. All the code changes we made earlier ensure that new meetings will be saved to this file. You can continue using the system as normal, and all meeting data will be stored in `ai-agent-meetings.json`.

Is there anything else you'd like me to help you with?

_**User**_

still i can't see @ai-agent-meetings.json why this details are not visible in ai agent dashboard

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me help you investigate why the meetings from `ai-agent-meetings.json` are not showing up in the AI agent dashboard. Let me search through the codebase to find where the dashboard data is being loaded.

Let me search specifically for the dashboard-related code to understand how it's loading the data:

---

_****_



---

_****_



Let me try another search to find the dashboard code:

---

_****_



---

_****_



Let me check the dashboard page code:

---

_****_

Read file: src/app/dashboard/page.tsx

---

_****_



Let me check the AI agent view component since that seems to be responsible for displaying the dashboard:

---

_****_

Read file: src/components/ai-agent-view.tsx

I see the issue. The dashboard is trying to fetch posted meetings from `/api/posted-meetings` endpoint, but it's not properly reading from the `ai-agent-meetings.json` file. Let me search for the API endpoint code:

---

_****_



---

_****_



Let me check the API endpoint:

---

_****_

Read file: src/pages/api/posted-meetings.ts

---

_****_



I see the issue now. The API endpoint is using `storageManager.loadMeetings()` which is looking for processed meetings, but we need to use the `AIAgentPostedMeetingsStorage` class to get the posted meetings from `ai-agent-meetings.json`. Let me modify the API endpoint:

---

_****_

```diff
  import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next';
  import { getSession } from 'next-auth/react';
- import { storageManager } from '../../ai-agent/data/storage/manager';
- import { ProcessedMeeting } from '../../interfaces/meetings';
+ import { AIAgentPostedMeetingsStorage } from '../../ai-agent/services/storage/posted-meetings';
  
  interface UnmatchedMeeting {
          }
  
-         // Load all meetings from storage
-         const meetings = await storageManager.loadMeetings();
-         
-         // Filter meetings for the current user and sort by last processed date
-         const userMeetings = meetings
-             .filter(meeting => meeting.userId === userId)
-             .sort((a, b) => new Date(b.lastProcessed).getTime() - new Date(a.lastProcessed).getTime());
+         // Load meetings using AIAgentPostedMeetingsStorage
+         const storage = new AIAgentPostedMeetingsStorage();
+         await storage.loadData();
+         const postedMeetings = await storage.getPostedMeetings(userId);
+ 
+         // Sort meetings by posted date
+         const sortedMeetings = postedMeetings.sort((a, b) => 
+             new Date(b.postedAt).getTime() - new Date(a.postedAt).getTime()
+         );
  
          // Get unmatched meetings from the last processing attempt
          return res.status(200).json({
              success: true,
-             meetings: userMeetings,
+             meetings: sortedMeetings,
              unmatchedMeetings,
              summary: {
-                 total: userMeetings.length,
+                 total: sortedMeetings.length,
                  unmatched: unmatchedMeetings.length
              }
```

Now the API endpoint will correctly fetch meetings from `ai-agent-meetings.json`. The dashboard should now show the posted meetings. Please try refreshing your dashboard page and let me know if you can see the meetings now.

If you're still not seeing the meetings, we should:
1. Make sure you're logged in with the same email address that's in the meetings data (`ramesh@m365x65088219.onmicrosoft.com`)
2. Check if the API endpoint is being called correctly from the frontend
3. Verify that the data is being properly formatted for display in the dashboard

Let me know if you need help with any of these steps or if you're still not seeing the meetings after refreshing the dashboard.

_**User**_

still not visible i want to check api 

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you check the API. Let's add some console logging to the API endpoint to see what's happening at each step. This will help us understand if:
1. The API is being called
2. The session and user ID are correct
3. The meetings are being loaded correctly
4. What data is being returned

---

```diff
      res: NextApiResponse

      if (req.method !== 'GET') {

          return res.status(405).json({ error: 'Method not allowed' });
      }
  
      try {
+         console.log('API: Getting session...');
          const session = await getSession({ req });
+         console.log('API: Session:', session);
+ 
          if (!session) {
+             console.log('API: No session found');
              return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Unauthorized' });
          }
  
          const userId = session.user?.email;

          if (!userId) {

              return res.status(400).json({ error: 'User ID not found in session' });
          }
  
          // Load meetings using AIAgentPostedMeetingsStorage

          const storage = new AIAgentPostedMeetingsStorage();
+         
+         console.log('API: Loading data...');
          await storage.loadData();
+         
+         console.log('API: Getting posted meetings for user:', userId);
          const postedMeetings = await storage.getPostedMeetings(userId);
+         console.log('API: Found posted meetings:', postedMeetings);
  
          // Sort meetings by posted date
          const sortedMeetings = postedMeetings.sort((a, b) => 
              new Date(b.postedAt).getTime() - new Date(a.postedAt).getTime()
          );
+         console.log('API: Sorted meetings:', sortedMeetings);
  
          // Get unmatched meetings from the last processing attempt
          const unmatchedMeetings: UnmatchedMeeting[] = [];
  
-         return res.status(200).json({
+         const response = {
              success: true,
              meetings: sortedMeetings,
                  unmatched: unmatchedMeetings.length
              }
-         });
+         };
+         console.log('API: Sending response:', response);

      } catch (error: unknown) {
-         console.error('Error fetching posted meetings:', error);
+         console.error('API Error fetching posted meetings:', error);
          return res.status(500).json({ 
              success: false,
```

I've added detailed console logging throughout the API endpoint. Now we can see exactly what's happening when the endpoint is called.

To test the API, you can:

1. Open your browser's developer tools (F12 or right-click and select "Inspect")
2. Go to the "Console" tab
3. Refresh your dashboard page
4. Look for logs starting with "API:"

This will show us:
- If the API is being called
- What user is making the request
- If the session is valid
- What meetings are being loaded from the file
- What data is being sent back to the frontend

Additionally, you can directly test the API endpoint by opening this URL in your browser:
```
http://localhost:3000/api/posted-meetings
```

Please try these steps and let me know what you see in the console logs or if you get any errors. This will help us identify exactly where the issue is occurring.

api is working but not displaying in Agent Dashboard UI

_**Assistant**_

Let me check the AI Agent View component since it's responsible for displaying the dashboard UI. Let's see how it's processing the API response and displaying the data.
