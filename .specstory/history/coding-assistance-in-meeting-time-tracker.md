_**Assistant**_

Hello! I'm here to help you with your coding tasks. Since we're in your `meeting-time-tracker` workspace, what would you like to work on? I can help you with:

1. Creating new features
2. Debugging existing code
3. Code improvements or refactoring
4. Understanding the current codebase
5. Any other coding-related tasks

Just let me know what you'd like to do and I'll be happy to assist!

scan the code base i want to deploy this in azure app services guide how can i deploy this in how many methos are there list it out dont write code now

I'll scan the codebase first to understand what kind of application we're working with and then outline the deployment methods for Azure App Services.

Based on the codebase analysis, I can see this is a Next.js application with TypeScript, using various Azure and Microsoft Graph integrations. Let me outline the different methods you can use to deploy this application to Azure App Services:

1. **Direct Deployment from Source Control**
   - GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
   - Azure DevOps Pipelines
   - Bitbucket Pipelines
   - This is recommended as it provides automated deployments and version control

2. **Local Deployment Methods**
   - Azure CLI (`az webapp up`)
   - Visual Studio Code with Azure App Service extension
   - Azure App Service VSCode extension
   - Local Git deployment to Azure App Service

3. **Container-based Deployment**
   - Build a Docker container and deploy to App Service
   - Push to Azure Container Registry and deploy
   - Use multi-container with Docker Compose
   
4. **Manual Deployment Methods**
   - ZIP deploy using Azure Portal
   - ZIP deploy using Azure CLI
   - FTP deployment (not recommended for production)

5. **Platform-specific Deployment (Next.js)**
   - Static Export deployment
   - Server-side rendering (SSR) deployment
   - Hybrid deployment (static + SSR)

Key Considerations for Your App:
1. You'll need to configure environment variables in Azure App Service for:
   - Azure AD credentials
   - Microsoft Graph API settings
   - Other sensitive data from your `.env.local`

2. Production Build Requirements:
   - Node.js runtime
   - NPM/Yarn for package installation
   - Build command configuration

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these methods or shall we proceed with implementing a specific deployment approach?

To deploy your Next.js application to Azure App Services using GitHub Actions, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Set Up Your Azure App Service

1. **Create an Azure App Service**:
   - Go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
   - Create a new App Service with the appropriate settings (e.g., Node.js runtime).

2. **Configure App Settings**:
   - Set environment variables in the App Service settings for any sensitive data or configuration needed by your app.

### Step 2: Prepare Your GitHub Repository

1. **Ensure Your Code is in GitHub**:
   - Push your code to a GitHub repository if it's not already there.

2. **Create a `.github/workflows` Directory**:
   - This is where your GitHub Actions workflow files will reside.
