Let me help you investigate the linter errors and the potential impact of downgrading React. First, I'll check your project's configuration and dependencies.

Let me check the build errors you're encountering:

```
npm run build
```

Based on the build output, I can see that the errors you're encountering are not directly related to React 19 vs 18. The issues are primarily TypeScript and ESLint errors, specifically:

1. TypeScript type errors (`no-explicit-any`)
2. Unused variables warnings
3. React hooks dependency warnings
4. Import style issues

Downgrading from React 19 to 18 won't solve these particular issues because they are related to code quality and type safety rather than React version compatibility. Here's what you should do instead:

1. Fix the TypeScript `any` types by providing proper type definitions
2. Remove or use the unused variables
3. Fix the React hooks dependencies
4. Use proper import statements instead of `require()`

If you want to proceed with fixing these issues, I can help you address them one by one. Would you like me to help you fix these linter errors while keeping React 19, or do you have a specific reason for wanting to downgrade to React 18?
