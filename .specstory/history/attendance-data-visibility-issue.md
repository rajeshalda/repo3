## Attendance Data Visibility Issue (2/3/2025, 10:14:39 PM)

_**User**_

actual attendance is not visible ?

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me help investigate why the actual attendance is not visible in the meetings table. I'll check the relevant code to understand how attendance data is being handled.

First, let me look at how meetings data is processed and displayed.

_**Assistant**_



Based on the code I've found, I can see that the actual attendance data is being properly handled in the application. Let me check how the data is being fetched and processed to identify why it's not showing up.

---

_**Assistant**_

_**Assistant**_



Looking at the code, I can see that the attendance data is being properly fetched from the Microsoft Graph API and processed. Let me check the frontend component to see how it's being displayed.

---

_**Assistant**_

_**Assistant**_



After reviewing the code, I can see that the attendance data should be visible in the UI. The issue might be related to one of these potential causes:

1. The meetings are not Teams meetings (attendance is only available for Teams meetings)
2. The attendance data is not being successfully fetched from the Microsoft Graph API
3. The user's session information might not be properly set up

Let me check the console logs to see if there are any errors being reported when fetching attendance data.

```
Get-Content -Path ".\logs\app.log" -Tail 100 | Select-String "attendance|error|Reports Data|Records Data"
```

_**Assistant**_



I see. Let me check if the meetings in your list are Teams meetings, since attendance data is only available for Teams meetings.

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



Based on the code and the screenshot you shared, I can see that:

1. The meetings in your list are Teams meetings (they have the "Teams" badge)
2. The meetings are showing as "Not attended" which means either:
   - The attendance data wasn't successfully fetched from the Microsoft Graph API
   - Or you weren't actually in these meetings

Let me check a few things:

1. First, let's verify if these meetings have already happened (attendance data is only available after the meeting)
2. Second, let's check if you were the organizer of these meetings (attendance data is only available to meeting organizers)

From the screenshot, I can see:
- Meeting 1: "Test meeting-for Universal Music Group..." at Wed, Jan 29, 10:39 PM
- Meeting 2: "Meeting for UMG discussion" at Wed, Jan 29, 10:48 AM

Both meetings are scheduled for January 29th, but they haven't happened yet since the date shown in the "Last Posted" field is 2/3/2025. This explains why there's no attendance data available - the meetings haven't taken place yet.

The attendance data will become available after:
1. The meetings have actually occurred
2. The attendees have joined and left the meeting
3. Microsoft Graph API has processed and made the attendance data available (which typically happens shortly after the meeting ends)

Is this what you expected, or would you like me to investigate anything else about the attendance tracking?

ohh i forgot that, can you modified this date & time as in first line is dark black color but in second line its light dark color i want same dark color

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you modify the date & time text color to make it consistent. Let me check the relevant component and make the necessary changes.

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



I can see that the issue is in the dashboard component where the date & time is displayed. The second line (end time) is using the `text-muted-foreground` class which makes it lighter. Let me modify this to make both lines have the same color.

---

_**Assistant**_

```
// ... existing code ...
                            <TableCell className="whitespace-nowrap px-4 py-3">
                              <div>{formatDate(meeting.startTime)}</div>
                              <div className="text-xs mt-0.5">
                                to {formatDate(meeting.endTime)}
                              </div>
                            </TableCell>
// ... existing code ...
```

---

_**Assistant**_



I've removed the `text-muted-foreground` class from the end time display, which means both the start time and end time will now have the same dark color. The change should be visible immediately in your UI.

The only styling I kept is:
- `text-xs`: to keep the slightly smaller font size
- `mt-0.5`: to maintain the small margin at the top

Now both lines should appear in the same dark color. Is there anything else you'd like me to adjust about the date & time display?

_**User**_

thanks working , in task matches i see that its only shows starting date only i want end date also

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you modify the task matches display to show both the start and end time, similar to how it's shown in the Fetched Meetings table.

Let me check the meeting matches component and make the necessary changes.

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



Let me modify the meeting matches component to show both start and end times. I'll update the display format to match the Fetched Meetings table.

---

_**Assistant**_

```
// ... existing code ...
                <div className="flex flex-col">
                  <div className="font-medium">{result.meeting.subject}</div>
                  <div className="text-xs">
                    {convertToIST(result.meeting.startTime)}
                  </div>
                  <div className="text-xs">
                    to {convertToIST(result.meeting.endTime)}
                  </div>
                </div>
// ... existing code ...
```

---

_**Assistant**_



I've updated the meeting matches display to show both the start and end times in the same format as the Fetched Meetings table. The changes include:

1. Added the end time display with "to" prefix
2. Made both time displays use the same text size (`text-xs`)
3. Arranged them in a vertical layout using `flex-col`
4. Removed the muted foreground color to keep both times equally visible

The times will now be displayed in this format:
```
Meeting Title
Wed, Jan 29, 10:39 PM IST
to Wed, Jan 29, 11:09 PM IST
```

Is there anything else you'd like me to adjust about the date and time display?

---

_**User**_

in fetch meeting i IST must vsisble its not visisble 

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you add the "IST" suffix to the date and time display in the Fetched Meetings table. Let me modify the `formatDate` function in the dashboard component.

---

_**Assistant**_

```
function formatDate(dateString: string) {
  const date = new Date(dateString);
  // Convert to IST by adding 5 hours and 30 minutes offset
  const istDate = new Date(date.getTime() + (5.5 * 60 * 60 * 1000));
  return istDate.toLocaleString('en-US', {
    weekday: 'short',
    month: 'short',
    day: 'numeric',
    hour: 'numeric',
    minute: '2-digit',
    hour12: true,
    timeZone: 'Asia/Kolkata'
  }) + ' IST';
}
```

---

_**Assistant**_



I've updated the `formatDate` function to append " IST" to the formatted date string. Now all the dates in the Fetched Meetings table should show the IST suffix, making it clear that the times are in Indian Standard Time.

The dates will now be displayed in this format:
```
Wed, Jan 29, 10:39 PM IST
to Wed, Jan 29, 11:09 PM IST
```

Is there anything else you'd like me to adjust about the date and time display?

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Property 'totalAttendanceInSeconds' does not exist on type 'AttendanceRecord'.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

---

_**Assistant**_

The error occurs because we're trying to access properties from the raw record directly. Let me fix the type mismatch in the mapping function.

---

_**Assistant**_

```
// ... existing code ...
          if (attendanceRecords) {
            meetingData.attendanceRecords = attendanceRecords.map((record: RawAttendanceRecord) => ({
              name: record.identity.displayName,
              email: record.emailAddress,
              duration: record.totalAttendanceInSeconds,
              intervals: record.attendanceIntervals,
              rawRecord: record
            }));
          }
// ... existing code ...
```

_**Assistant**_



I apologize for the failed edit. Let me try again with a more specific change:

---

_**Assistant**_

```
          if (attendanceRecords) {
            meetingData.attendanceRecords = attendanceRecords.map((record: RawAttendanceRecord) => ({
              name: record.identity.displayName,
              email: record.emailAddress,
              duration: record.totalAttendanceInSeconds,
              intervals: record.attendanceIntervals,
              rawRecord: record
            }));
          }
```

---

_**Assistant**_



I apologize for the difficulty with the edit tool. Here's what needs to be changed to fix the error:

In `src/app/api/meetings/route.ts`, around line 212, change:
```typescript
attendanceRecords.map((record: AttendanceRecord) => ({
```
to:
```typescript
attendanceRecords.map((record: RawAttendanceRecord) => ({
```

This fixes the type error because `RawAttendanceRecord` has all the properties we're trying to access (`identity`, `emailAddress`, `totalAttendanceInSeconds`, and `attendanceIntervals`), while `AttendanceRecord` is the transformed type that we're creating.

Would you like me to try the edit again with a different approach?
