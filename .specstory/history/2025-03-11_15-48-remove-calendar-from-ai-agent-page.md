_**User**_

i see that calender picker is visisble all across the section like posted meeting and ai-agent its must visible only in dashboard where manual app is working scan the code base to remove it from other section

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you search through the codebase to find where the calendar picker is being rendered and remove it from sections where it shouldn't be visible.

First, let me search for relevant code:

Let me analyze the codebase. I can see that the calendar picker component is being used in multiple places. The main implementation is in the `DateRangePicker` component, and it's being rendered in different views. To ensure it's only visible in the dashboard where manual app is working, we need to:

1. Check where it's currently being rendered
2. Remove it from unwanted sections
3. Keep it only in the dashboard view

Let me search specifically for where the DateRangePicker is being used:

Let me search specifically for the AI Agent view to see where we need to remove the calendar:

Based on my analysis, I can see that the calendar picker is being rendered in multiple places:

1. In the main dashboard view (`src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`)
2. In the AI Agent view (`src/ai-agent/components/ai-agent-view.tsx` and `src/components/ai-agent-view.tsx`)

Let me check the routing structure to understand how these views are organized:

Based on the codebase analysis, I can see that the application has a main dashboard page that renders different views based on the `currentView` state. The calendar picker is currently being rendered in multiple places:

1. In the main dashboard header
2. In the AI Agent view
3. In the Posted Meetings view

To ensure the calendar picker is only visible in the dashboard where manual app is working, we need to modify the code. Let me make the necessary changes:

---

_****_

```diff
  
                <div className="flex items-center gap-4">
-                 {/* Only show DateRangePicker in header if meetings are fetched */}
-                 {meetingsData && dateRange?.from && dateRange?.to && (
+                 {/* Only show DateRangePicker in header if in dashboard view */}
+                 {currentView === 'dashboard' && meetingsData && dateRange?.from && dateRange?.to && (
                    <DateRangePicker
                      dateRange={dateRange}
```

Now let me check if there are any other places where the DateRangePicker is being rendered in the AI Agent view:

---

_**User**_

it is possible to create a button in ai-agent dasboard to clear the Recently Posted Meetings section @ai-agent-meetings.json is it possbile ? dont write code

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, it's definitely possible to create a button in the AI Agent dashboard to clear the recently posted meetings stored in `ai-agent-meetings.json`. Here's how it would work conceptually:

1. Add a "Clear History" or "Clear Posted Meetings" button in the AI Agent dashboard next to the "Recently Posted Meetings" section

2. When clicked, the button would:
   - Make an API call to a backend endpoint that would clear the contents of `ai-agent-meetings.json`
   - Reset the meetings array to empty in the file
   - Refresh the UI to show no posted meetings

3. The implementation would require:
   - A new API endpoint to handle clearing the JSON file
   - Frontend button with click handler to call this endpoint
   - Error handling and success notifications
   - UI feedback during the clearing process

This would be similar to the existing "Reset Posted" functionality in the main dashboard, but specifically for the AI Agent's posted meetings history.

Would you like me to help you implement this feature with the actual code?

implement it so that we can clear @ai-agent-meetings.json
