Yes, it's definitely possible to add logging to your application! Python has a built-in `logging` module that's great for this purpose. I can show you a basic example of how to set up logging:

```python
import logging

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(
    filename='app.log',  # Log file name
    level=logging.DEBUG,  # Log level
    format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',  # Log format
    datefmt='%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'  # Date format
)

# Example usage
def some_function():
    logging.debug('This is a debug message')
    logging.info('This is an info message')
    logging.warning('This is a warning message')
    logging.error('This is an error message')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    some_function()
```

When you run this code, it will create a file named `app.log` in your project directory. The log file will contain entries like:
```
2024-03-14 15:30:45 - DEBUG - This is a debug message
2024-03-14 15:30:45 - INFO - This is an info message
2024-03-14 15:30:45 - WARNING - This is a warning message
2024-03-14 15:30:45 - ERROR - This is an error message
```

You can use different logging levels:
- DEBUG: Detailed information for debugging
- INFO: General information about program execution
- WARNING: Indicates a potential problem
- ERROR: A more serious problem
- CRITICAL: A critical error that may prevent the program from running

Would you like me to show you how to integrate logging into your specific code? Just share the code you want to add logging to!
