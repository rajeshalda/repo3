### Processing Cycle Improvements

1. **Cycle Overlap Prevention**
   - Added protection to prevent a new cycle from starting if the previous one is still running
   - Eliminates race conditions when processing a large number of meetings
   - Ensures all meetings are processed correctly without interference between cycles

2. **Extended Processing Interval**
   - Increased the processing cycle interval from 5 minutes to 30 minutes
   - Provides more time to complete processing of multiple meetings
   - Reduces system load and API calls while maintaining timely updates

### Files Modified

1. `ai-agent-server.js`
   - Added processing cycle lock mechanism
   - Updated interval timing from 5 to 30 minutes

2. Documentation and UI
   - Updated all references to the processing cycle interval
   - Updated user-facing messages to reflect the new 30-minute cycle

## Previous Changes

### Meeting Fetching Changes

1. **Current Day Meetings Only**
   - Modified the system to fetch only the current day's meetings instead of the previous 7 days
   - All date boundaries are now calculated using IST timezone (UTC+05:30)
   - Start time: 00:00:00 IST of the current day
   - End time: 23:59:59 IST of the current day

2. **Processing Cycle**
   - Changed the processing cycle to run every 30 minutes (increased from 5 minutes)
   - This ensures new meetings are picked up throughout the day while preventing overlap of cycles

3. **Timezone Handling**
   - All date calculations properly handle the IST timezone (UTC+05:30)
   - Meetings are fetched and displayed in IST timezone
   - Date boundaries are correctly calculated by adjusting for the UTC offset

4. **Day Boundary Handling**
   - When a new day begins, the system automatically starts fetching that day's meetings
   - Previous days' meetings are no longer included in the processing

### Files Modified

1. `src/ai-agent/services/meeting/test.ts`
   - Updated `fetchUserMeetings` function to only get current day's meetings
   - Added proper IST timezone handling for date ranges
   - Updated console logging to reflect current day focus

2. `graph-meetings.ts` and `graph-meetings.js`
   - Updated date range calculation to only include current day
   - Added IST timezone handling
   - Updated console logging

3. `src/ai-agent/flow.md`
   - Updated documentation to reflect the current day focus and 5-minute processing cycle

### Benefits

1. **Improved Performance**
   - Reduced API calls by focusing only on the current day's meetings
   - Less data to process, leading to faster response times

2. **Better User Experience**
   - Users only see relevant (today's) meetings
   - No confusion with past meetings showing up

3. **More Accurate Time Entries**
   - Time entries are created more promptly for today's meetings
   - No delayed processing of meetings from previous days
