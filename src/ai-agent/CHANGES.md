# AI Agent Changes

## Date: [Current Date]

### Meeting Fetching Changes

1. **Current Day Meetings Only**
   - Modified the system to fetch only the current day's meetings instead of the previous 7 days
   - All date boundaries are now calculated using IST timezone (UTC+05:30)
   - Start time: 00:00:00 IST of the current day
   - End time: 23:59:59 IST of the current day

2. **Processing Cycle**
   - Confirmed the processing cycle runs every 5 minutes (no changes needed)
   - This ensures new meetings are picked up promptly throughout the day

3. **Timezone Handling**
   - All date calculations properly handle the IST timezone (UTC+05:30)
   - Meetings are fetched and displayed in IST timezone
   - Date boundaries are correctly calculated by adjusting for the UTC offset

4. **Day Boundary Handling**
   - When a new day begins, the system automatically starts fetching that day's meetings
   - Previous days' meetings are no longer included in the processing

### Files Modified

1. `src/ai-agent/services/meeting/test.ts`
   - Updated `fetchUserMeetings` function to only get current day's meetings
